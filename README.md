# ETAP mobile responsive Web page
 ## Part 1- our MVP:
 #### Idea: To build a mobile app where volunteer coordinators can keep track of their collection sites, location and data.
 #### Target Users: Volunteer Coordinators
 #### Problem: Limited given time, building an app from scratch
 #### Goal: Our goal is to provide an easy way to volunteer coordinators to report their work
 ### User Stories:
  1. As a coordinator, I want to enter in information about the site so that I can categorize the location with metadata
  2. As a coordinator, I want to support volunteers with questions via a lookup list (autocomplete dictionary) so that I can keep people moving along
  3. As a coordinator, I want to take a picture of the totaled litter for a category so that I can enhance the data and make it more robust
  4. As a coordinator, I want to enter a total count for given category, as reported by volunteers so that I can quantify the data for a category
  5. As a coordinator, I want to double count minimum 4 categories for a site cleanup, so that I can meet the QAPP (Quality Assurance Project Plan) regulation
  6. As a coordinator, I want to be able to select a threat assessment category, enter a count in that given category, so that I can make the data more robust
  7. As a coordinator, I want to enter a weight (in grams, oz, or lbs - at discretion) of a given category, so that I can make the data more robust
  8. As a coordinator, I want to enter any additional notes (such as brands) for a given category in a free form field, so that I can make the data more robust
  9. As a coordinator, I want to capture the lat/long of a site (i.e. polygon) and have the application calculate the square footage of the cleanup
  10. As a coordinator I should be able to sign up and sign in to the website.
