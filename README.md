 ## Part 1- our MVP:
 #### Idea: To build a mobile app where volunteer coordinators can keep track of their collection sites, location and data.
 #### Target Users: Volunteer Coordinators
 #### Problem: Limited given time, building an app from scratch
 #### Goal: Our goal is to provide an easy way to volunteer coordinators to report their work
  
 ## Current Gaps
  * Customize icons for menu
  * Downloading button for forms
  * Information on how to recycle
  * Photos associated with each event
  
#### Instructions:
  * Log in
  * Left side menu navigate to Sign Up forms
  * Navigate to site by location to view site's collection data
  * To use the map, you need to capture lat/long using the button (add location) in site info view. Accurately capturing the lat/long requires a mobile device's GPS to be available


### Maintenance Instructions: 
  * To update the lookup list of hard to categorize items, update the static list in Lookup.js. Any suggestion will be done automatically 
  * To add any additional fields to the form, formData will need to be updated (numerous examples exist in this repo of how to do that)
  
  
### Material and Tools
  * Javascript
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
  * [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite)
